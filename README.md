# The nurse scheduling problem 

The nurse scheduling problem is a well-known scheduling problem which assigns nurses to shifts per day taking both hard and soft constraints into account. The objective is to maximize the preferences of the nurses and to minimize the total penalty cost from violations of the soft constraints. In this research track, we present various novel meta-heuristic techniques based on the principles of Genetic Algorithmic search, Scatter Search principles, Electromagnetism, etc. Below, you can download the NSPLib benchmark instances, best known solutions, a problem generator as well as executables for various meta-heuristic procedures to solve the nurse scheduling problem.
